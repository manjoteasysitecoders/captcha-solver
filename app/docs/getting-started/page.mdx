# Getting Started

This guide walks you through the complete process of using our CAPTCHA Solver — from account creation to sending your first API request.

You’ll be up and running in just a few minutes.

---

## Step 1: Create an Account

Before using our CAPTCHA-solving services, you need to create an account.

Once registered, you’ll gain access to:

- Your personal dashboard
- API key management
- Credit tracking
- Requests count
- Send CAPTCHA requests

Create your account from the **[Sign Up](/signup)** page.

---

## Step 2: Purchase Credits

We provide free credits initially.

Our platform uses a **credit-based pricing model**.

Purchase credits to activate CAPTCHA-solving APIs.

### Why Credits?

- No subscriptions
- No recurring fees
- Pay only for what you use

Credits are deducted automatically when a valid API request is accepted.

---

## Step 3: Generate an API Key

After purchasing credits, you can generate an API key from your dashboard.
Your API key is required to authenticate every API request.

**Keep your API key secure**. Do not expose it in client-side code or public repositories.

---

## Step 4: Send a CAPTCHA Request

With your API key ready, you can now send CAPTCHA-solving requests.

Below is an example of using the **Image CAPTCHA API**.

### Image CAPTCHA Request

```
const response = await fetch("/api/public/imageCaptcha", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "x-api-key": "YOUR_API_KEY",
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    imageUrl: "https://example.com/captcha.png",
  }),
});

const data = await response.json();
console.log(data);
```

**If the request is valid and your account has sufficient credits, the API will return the extracted text in the response.**

## Supported CAPTCHA APIs

Our platform supports the following CAPTCHA formats:

- **Image CAPTCHA Recognition** – Extracts text from image-based CAPTCHAs
- **Text CAPTCHA Parsing** - Extracts the final answer from text-based challenges
- **Audio CAPTCHA Transcription** – Transcribes audio CAPTCHAs into text

Each API is designed to be simple, fast, and synchronous.

---

## Step 5: Receive the response

All CAPTCHA APIs return results synchronously in the response body.

A successful response looks like this:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Text extracted successfully.",
  "text": "X7K9P"
}
```

- Image and text CAPTCHA requests typically return results immediately
- Audio CAPTCHA requests may take slightly longer, depending on audio length

There is no task creation, background processing, or polling required.


## Error Handling

If a request fails, the API will return an appropriate HTTP status code and error message, such as:

- Missing or invalid API key
- Insufficient credits
- Invalid request parameters
- Internal server errors

Always handle non-200 responses gracefully in your application.

---

## Best Practices

To ensure reliable and secure usage of the CAPTCHA Solver APIs:

- Store API keys securely on the server
- Never expose API keys in frontend code
- Monitor credit usage through the dashboard
- Implement retries only for network or server errors
- Ensure you have proper authorization to automate CAPTCHA-protected systems
